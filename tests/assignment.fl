# TODO Would like to be able to test errors too (e.g. identifier reassignment), but need a different testing setup or perhaps a new language construct (try? "attempt" to not induce confusion with try in other languages?) to do this.

let a = 69
let b = 420

a = 420
b = 69

assert a - b == 351

# Self-assignment regression test.

a = a + 1

assert a == 421
